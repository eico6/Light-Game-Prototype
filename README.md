## Description 
- The prototype "Light" is a short shooter/platformer game, with the intention of representing an idea for further development.
- This project was the exam delivery of the course "Programming 2" at "Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences".
- There is no audio in the game, other than background music. This is because it was not among our priorities as we
  were not evaluated on this spesific subject.
